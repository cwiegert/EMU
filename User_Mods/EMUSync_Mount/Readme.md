# EMUSync_Mount

Wanted to stabalized the PSF body and not have it hanging loose in the bowden path.   Maing sure the bowden path did not have any sharp bends, curves and having the PSF as close to the EMU as possible drove the overall design.    The mounts allow for perpendicular (hanging off the back) and parallel to the extrusion mounting.

## Overview

It's specifically designed for the square body EMUSync in the EMU repo.   If another body type is used, a new clamp could be mounted directly to the mounting plate.   The entire clamp system can be printed without supports, and printed in the orientation with the largest flat side down.   The STL's and STEP's are filed in print orinentation.    

Assembly is straight forward simply print the parts, insert the adaptor plate in 1 of the peg holes, insert the secondary securing peg, insert the square nuts, use M3x14mm screws to secure the adaptor plate.  for best results use a M3x6 or M3x8 BHS for mounting the clamp to the adaptor plate.   M3x8mm screw to secure the clamp top

both 4040 and 2020 mounts are avialable and with the edges of the mount extended to act as panel clamp.
