## EMU LED PCB

The **EMU LED PCB** is a dedicated PCB designed for the EMU to enable dynamic lighting effects on the eject button assembly. It also simplifies wiring and reduces the need for soldering.

## BOM variations vs. baseline EMU BOM
Do not purchase the below from the base BOM:
1. 1 less neopixel
2. 1 less D2F-L switch
3. 4 less 6x3mm magnets

Add the below to the base BOM, depending on your LED PCB source:
1. 1x JST-XH 5 pin PCB header

## Manual
Assembly and wiring instructions are outlined [in the manual](https://github.com/DW-Tas/EMU/blob/main/PCB%20(recommended%20options)/multi_led_button/EMU%20LED%20Button%20PCB%20Assembly%20Manual.pdf).

## Sourcing
The hatch board PCBs can be sourced from the below location:
1. [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005011529532141.html) in sets of 5

Alternatively use the supplied gerber, BOM and pick and place files to order from your favourite PCB manufacturer.

## Software setup

Update your **LED definitions** in the mmu_hardware.cfg as below. **Key change is chain count is equal to 5 instead of 2.**
```
[neopixel mmu0_leds] # one block per lane (Lane 0)
pin: mmu0:MMU_NEOPIXEL
chain_count: 5			# four for the eject button and one for the box
color_order: GRBW		

[neopixel mmu1_leds] # one block per lane (Lane 1)
pin: mmu1:MMU_NEOPIXEL
chain_count: 5			# four for the eject button and one for the box
color_order: GRBW	

[....]

[neopixel mmuN_leds] # one block per lane (Lane 1)
pin: mmuN:MMU_NEOPIXEL
chain_count: 5			# four for the eject button and one for the box
color_order: GRBW
```
Update your **LED allocation** to exit and entry LEDs in the mmu_hardware.cfg as below. **Key change is that leds 1 through to 4 are exit LEDs and LED 5 is the entry LED.**
```
[mmu_leds unit0]
exit_leds:
  neopixel:mmu0_leds (1,2,3,4) # add/remove lines to match number of lanes. LED 1-4 is for the button
  neopixel:mmu1_leds (1,2,3,4)
  [...]
  neopixel:mmuN_leds (1,2,3,4)
entry_leds:
  neopixel:mmu0_leds (5) # add/remove lines to match number of lanes. LED 5 is for the box
  neopixel:mmu1_leds (5)
  [...]
  neopixel:mmuN_leds (5)
frame_rate: 24
```

## Wiring variations
The DOut pin (LED out) should connect to a 600mm AWG26-28 wire going to the LED IN pin of the lane dry box. Thatway the third wago can be ommitted.

## Lighting effects
The multiple LEDs incorporated in the eject button allow you to create loading/unloading animations like the below. Also the integrated SMD switch provides a more tactile feel vs. the D2F switch and magnet assembly. 

The lighting effects are enabled automatically by happy hare.
